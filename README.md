# Study on LGBT Anxiety and Depression

## Info

This is an overview of 2020-2023 data in regards to symptoms of anxiety and depression in a 7 day period. The data collected for this survey reflects many different groups; however, I'd like to focus on the LGBT+ community and Disabled community to show the extreme shift on the scale. Mental Health is a concern across all margins, but magnifying it's effects on some of our most vulnerable groups is vital for visibility. 

## Notes

There are flaws in the dataset, in regards to 2023 the data does not reflect the entire year. Also, as noted in the powerpoint, this survey began in 2020 however data for disabled and LGBT+ groups were not demarcated. That is an issue in itself as it perpetuates the issue of burying those minorities. As well, specifically in the data regarding the Disabled - depression and anxiety is classified as a disability, so it could be inferred that those who suffer chronically would feel more symptoms. This does not take away from those with a disability who do not have diagnosed anxiety or depression feeling more symptoms than the average non-Disabled individual, but it could mean a skew in the percentages. 

Please take this information as it is, but keep your mind open to new, improved data.
